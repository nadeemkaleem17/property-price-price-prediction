This data science project series guides you through building a real estate price prediction website step by step. First, we'll create a model using scikit-learn
and linear regression with a home prices dataset from Bangalore, available on Kaggle. 
Next, we'll develop a Python Flask server that uses the saved model to handle HTTP requests.
Finally, we'll build a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where users can input home details like square footage and bedrooms to get a price prediction from the Flask server.

Throughout the model-building process, we'll cover key data science concepts such as data loading and cleaning,
 outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction. 
 
 # The project will use the following technologies and tools:

  <li /> Python
  <li /> Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
  <li /> Matplotlib for data visualization
  <li /> Scikit-learn for model building
  <li /> Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm as IDEs
  <li /> Python Flask for the HTTP server
  <li /> HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the user interface


  ## Deploy this app to cloud (AWS EC2)

    Create an EC2 instance and configure it to allow HTTP traffic.
    Connect to the instance using SSH to manage it remotely.
    Install and set up Nginx as the web server.
    Upload project files to the EC2 instance using a tool like WinSCP.
    Configure Nginx to serve your web app and route API requests to the Flask server.
    Install necessary Python packages and start the Flask server to handle backend operations.
