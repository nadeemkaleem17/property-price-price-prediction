This data science project series guides through building a real estate price prediction website step by step. First, create a model using scikit-learn
and linear regression with a home prices dataset from Bangalore, available on Kaggle. 
Next, develop a Python Flask server that uses the saved model to handle HTTP requests.
Finally, build a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where users can input home details like square footage and bedrooms to get a price prediction from the Flask server.

Throughout the model-building process, key data science concepts are used such as data loading and cleaning,
outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction. 
 
 # The project will use the following technologies and tools:

  <li /> Python
  <li /> Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
  <li /> Matplotlib for data visualization
  <li /> Scikit-learn for model building
  <li /> Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm as IDEs
  <li /> Python Flask for the HTTP server
  <li /> HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the user interface


  ## Deploy this app to cloud (AWS EC2)

  1- Create an EC2 instance and configure it to allow HTTP traffic. <br/>
  2- Connect to the instance using SSH to manage it remotely. <br/>
  3- Install and set up Nginx as the web server. <br/>
  4- Upload project files to the EC2 instance using a tool like WinSCP. <br/>
  5- Configure Nginx to serve your web app and route API requests to the Flask server. <br/>
  6- Install necessary Python packages and start the Flask server to handle backend operations.
